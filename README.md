This website has the following functionality - 
1. It allows users to 
  a. Search for books using the search bar.
  b. Add books to a cart and checkout.
  c. View their order history
  d. View books that are 'trending'
 
 2. It allows sellers to
  a. List books on the website
  b. Monitor their sales
 
 The website is functional as a whole. Eg: The books a seller lists will be accessible to the users.
 
 Next steps would be to include 
 1. adding a temporary discount to books.
 2. adding machine learning algorithms that make better recommendations.
 3. improving the user interface.
 4. an email subscription service.
 
 ## To get started -
 
 1. Set up a server with sql service enabled. I used Apache with sql service enabled.
 2. Create a database called 'bookschmo' and run the sql provide to set up a sample database
 3. Go to localhost/BookSchmo to run the website
 4. You will also need to install Bootstrap 4 to see the website.
